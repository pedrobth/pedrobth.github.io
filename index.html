                <strong>Here I am at the "Mirante Soberbo" near Teresopolis - RJ. Although some clouds are covering the "Dedo de Deus", it was a sunny day but not too warm, perfect for a hiking trail. Teresopolis has lots of trails, specially at "Serra dos Org√£os" National Park.</strong>

    <p id="about">I am passionate about technology and all it does to improve people's lives. I believe that much more can be delivered to improve life quality around the world. For me the key to achieve a better world is through education and providing access to trustful and quality knowledge. The internet is a powerful tool that allows this, but considering that is not regulated and also no content checking,it should be used carefully.</p>
