    <p><strong><em>Pedro Merchioratto Risso</em></strong></p>
    <p><strong>Here is just me in another regular covid day, coding and learning</strong></p>

    <p>I am a 35 Brazilian living in Rio de Janeiro - RJ</p>
    <p>Some coding abilities:
        <ul><strong>Python</strong></ul>
        <ul>Flask</ul>
        <ul>Bootstrap</ul>
        <ul>Postgresql</ul>
        <ul>SqlAlchemy</ul>
        <ul>Shell Script</ul>
    </p>
    <p>I am passionate about technology and all it does to improve people's lives. I believe that much more can be delivered to improve life quality around the world. In my point of view the key to achieve a better world is through education, especially providing access to trustful and quality knowledge. Although the internet delivers it, it also opened the possibility of fake news being spread.</p>
